			<h1>My Work:</h1>
			<p>I am still a beginner to Computer Software Developement and have much to learn. 
			Though with what I have learned I have worked on several projects throughout Highschool.
			I have worked on games for a programming competition hosted by Indian Hills Community College,
			and Web Developement using C# and ASP.Net Within my HighSchool Education.</p>
			<h2>Byte Jam:</h2>
			<p>In highschool I participated in a programming competition twice once my Junior year and once my Senior year.
			Each year I was assigned to a team to build a project of our choosing to be voted for by the audience.
			Both years my team built games using Unity within the 40 hours our teacher allowed us to work on the project with.
			Each time I worked in these teams I gained experience with programming with others using scrum and agile to track and organise projects.</p>
			<h2>C# Asp.net:</h2>
			<p>Within my C# programming class in highschool we worked on several projects using Visual Studio's windows forms,
			Web Forms and Console Applications using C#. Within this class we created a project using Static Classes,
			Constructors, and Loops. This project allowed us to put our knowledge into practice with a hands off style of teaching.
			Allowing students to plan together or work solo if they wanted to get the project to a finished product.</p>
