		<h1>Career Experience</h1>
		<h2>High School Organizations</h2>
		<p>I was in many clubs in high school, Robotics Club, Science Olympiad, and Macon Knights.
		I enjoyed each of these clubs as they each had their own projects to learn new things.
		In Robotics I learned many things like robot design and coding from the club entering the First Tech Challenge
		for high school students. We build our robot using a kit produced by the FTC, through this kit we made different
		iterations of our robot. We also learned about 3D printing and the used it to make custom parts for our robot.
		The Robotics club promoted problem solving and teamwork as we each had our own role in getting the robot for competition.</p>
		<h2>Long Branch Marina</h2>
		<p>I worked at the Long Branch Marina for two summers having a great experience both years.
		The job consisted of opening/closing the store, processing transactions, and pumping gas for customers.
		On my second year of working at the Long Branch Marina the Lake flooded to record high levels closing the beach
		and the boat ramp. This led to many customers asking questions during transactions so, I made sure to stay
		up to date asking other park employees to stay up to date on the conditions of the park. This allowed
		me the accurately warn visitors of flooding issues and give information on the reopening of the beach and boat ramp.</p>
		<h2>Indian Hills Organizations</h2>
		<p>This first term at Indian Hills Community College I have joined two organizations, The Computer
		Club and Esports Club. I have had many opportunities within the Computer club to visit conferences and
		companies in my field through them. I have also volunteered for the club to work a tip night, a can drive, and
		an Eighth Grader Day to raise club funds. I hope I only get more of these opportunities as my time at Indian Hills goes on.</p>
